## Description
This project demonstrates the ability to render a map on a web page and build and manipulate maps on web pages using the Mapbox library and API.

### Features
* Page displays a styled map of Cambridge, Massachusetts
* Clicking the button starts the animation
* The animation cycles through the bus stops between Harvard and MIT at an interval of 1 second

### Built With
* Mapbox
* Javascript
* CSS
* HTML

### How to Run
This will run locally in your browser from index.html if you download all files and ensure they're located in the same directory as each other and have the same file structure (i.e. images folder with separately stored images.) Alternately, you can see it in action <a href="https://jayeclark.github.io/bus-map-animation/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Planned Future Improvements
- [ ] Rewrite the animation to travel from Harvard to MIT and back, instead of only one direction
- [ ] Use the Mapbox library to smooth the transition from one stop to the next
- [ ] Add a toggle option for real time bus tracking to the map 
- [ ] Add the option to display map animations of bus stops at other locations
